reverse so FA is first if need be and express as symbol.

the 13 FA genes which get some assocciations and how many

those 13 genes get 
cut -f2 FA_dimotif_association.tab | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | wc -l
382

dimotif based associations. 
All but about 40 have one match and about 40 have two matches.


cut -f2 FA_dimotif_association.tab | sort -u > FA_candidate.list

Try some online Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
Panther does not recognize the curie prefix NCBIGene:

cut -f2 FA_dimotif_association.tab | sort -u | cut -f2 -d ':' > FA_candidate_id.list


goal here is to push out the 388 associations and see if anytihig points badk
in the general direction of the 13 FA genes

"protein binding" is not teribly specific molular function

try biological process

where we find we are enriched for "metabolic process"


cellular components gives us

hmmm may need some hand holding interperting results...

cytoplasm organelle doing the metabolic process of protein binding
is not taking me back as close to FA as I would have hoped but I am ignorant.

I guess the question is:

Is FA a failure of cytoplasm organelle doing the metabolic process of protein binding?

from: 
https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/fanconi/

FA prevents your bone marrow from making enough new blood cells for your body to work normally. 
FA also can cause your bone marrow to make many faulty blood cells. 
This can lead to serious health problems, such as leukemia (a type of blood cancer).


from: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanconi_anemia

FA is the result of a genetic defect in a cluster of proteins responsible for DNA repair.


if I squint it seems not contradictory.


One thing I did not check for nor correct for is other FA genes 
appearing as associations, which seems like it could happen.

join FA_NCBIGene_symbol.txt FA_candidate.list

NCBIGene:79728 PALB2

only one and it is associated with FAAP10

not enough to have colored these results with known FA genes.
