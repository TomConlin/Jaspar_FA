reverse so FA is first if need be and express as symbol.

those 13 genes get 
cut -f2 FA_dimotif_association.tab | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | wc -l

dimotif based associations. 
All but about 40 have one match and about 40 have two matches.


cut -f2 FA_dimotif_association.tab | sort -u > FA_candidate.list

Try some online Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
Panther does not recognize the curie prefix NCBIGene:

cut -f2 FA_dimotif_association.tab | sort -u | cut -f2 -d ':' > FA_candidate_id.list


goal here is to push out the 388 associations and see if anytihig points badk
in the general direction of the 13 FA genes

"protein binding" is not teribly specific molular function

try biological process

where we find we are enriched for "metabolic process"


cellular components gives us

hmmm may need some hand holding interperting results...

cytoplasm organelle doing the metabolic process of protein binding
is not taking me back as close to FA as I would have hoped but I am ignorant.

I guess the question is:

Is FA a failure of cytoplasm organelle doing the metabolic process of protein binding?

from 
https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/fanconi/

FA prevents your bone marrow from making enough new blood cells for your body to work normally. 
FA also can cause your bone marrow to make many faulty blood cells. 
This can lead to serious health problems, such as leukemia (a type of blood cancer).

that is not half bad.
